# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Exact application-token validation and Channel identity using the Gotify MU application identity endpoint when available.
- Safe legacy token-validation fallback that does not create a notification.
- Stable Channel-ID-based config-entry identity when supported by the server.
- Config-entry `runtime_data` architecture.
- Reauthentication flow for revoked or replaced credentials.
- Reconfiguration flow for server URL, Channel display name, TLS validation, and optional client-token replacement/removal.
- Optional realtime inbound Gotify MU messages over the client-token WebSocket stream.
- Home Assistant Event entity for inbound Channel messages.
- Inbound WebSocket connection-status binary sensor.
- Automatic stream reconnect with bounded exponential backoff.
- Loop prevention for messages sent by the same Home Assistant config entry.
- Explicit handling for authentication failures, rate limiting, server failures, connection errors, and request timeouts.
- Redacted config-entry diagnostics.
- Migration path from v0.1 config entries.
- Hassfest, Ruff, JSON, Python compile, and pytest validation workflow.

### Changed

- `gotify_mu.send` is registered at integration setup rather than per config entry.
- Notification entities advertise title support using Home Assistant's current `NotifyEntity` API.
- IoT classification is `local_push` for the direct self-hosted connection model.
- Optional client token is used only for Channel discovery/inbound subscription; application tokens remain the outbound publishing credential.

### Security

- Application/client tokens are redacted from diagnostics.
- Raw application tokens are never used as config-entry unique IDs.
- Inbound message text is exposed as event data only and is never executed automatically.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-26

- Initial Home Assistant custom integration.
- UI config flow.
- Gotify MU notification entity.
- `gotify_mu.send` action.
- Multiple config entries.
